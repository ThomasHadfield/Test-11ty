                            Design, at its best, is thoughtful and intentional. I approach design as a practice of patience and exploration, allowing ideas the time to grow and evolve. Play and experimentation are essential; it’s in the unexpected intersections that inspiring work is found and created.

                            Brutalism and mid-century modernism inform my visual language, two seemingly contrasting influences that converge in my work. I am drawn to brutalism’s raw, structured forms, where boldness meets functionality, while the timeless elegance and forward-thinking principles of mid-century design continue to inspire and ground my practice. Whether it's through research or collecting old materials, I continue to look back on the past to learn from the pioneers of modernism.

                            Typography is at the heart of my work. I’ve been fascinated by letters since childhood, experimenting with forms and shapes long before I called it design. For me, typography is not just a tool—it’s a medium for expression. I try to create typographic led design work, allowing their forms to stand on their own. This to me is what shapes memorable and engaging design.
