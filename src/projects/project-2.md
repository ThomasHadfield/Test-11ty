description: Monica is an interior designer from Toronto, Canada. A simple brand
  identity was created to live beside and help showcase her work when being
  presented within her portfolio. The new brand suits her clean style and
  approach to interior design, where she trys to create spaces that engage and
  incite interaction from its users. The logotype and layouts created are
  modular and can be adapted to whatever medium she uses them in. A custom
  website was created to help best showcase her work and to make sure she has a
  strong brand image on the web.
