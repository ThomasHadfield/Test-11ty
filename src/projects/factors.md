title: Factors
subject: Brand Identity & Website

description: Factors is a performance training app for pro athletes and coaches, with a focus on track cycling. They needed a forward-looking identity and web presence to help grow their community and gain investor trust. Since track cycling is all about milliseconds and data, I wanted to bring a more human feel to the brand. Using art-directed black and white photography, a muted colour palette, and a bright pink accent, I built a visual language that balances precision with personality. The result feels technical yet approachable â€” a brand that moves fast but stays grounded.
