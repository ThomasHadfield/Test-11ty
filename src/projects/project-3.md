  Monica is an interior designer from Toronto, Canada. A simple brand identity
  was created to live beside and help showcase her work when being presented
  within her portfolio. The new brand suits her clean style and approach to
  interior design, where she trys to create spaces that engage and incite
  interaction from its users. The logotype and layouts created are modular and
  can be adapted to whatever medium she uses them in. A custom website was
  created to help best showcase her work and to make sure she has a strong brand
  image on the web.
