title: Localcoin
subject: Brand Identity & Website

description: Localcoin is a cutting-edge crypto company headquartered in Toronto. Committed to simplifying the process of buying and selling bitcoins and various cryptocurrencies, Localcoin stands as Canada's premier Bitcoin ATM network, serving customers through a seamless combination of ATMs, online purchases, and wire transfers spanning across North America. They wanted their brand to stand out from the wide array of competition. We created a bold new logo that feels trustworthy and purposeful, while still capturing human warmth in a more cohesive and optimistic design system. Along with the rebrand, a new website and ATM design were created. This introduced a much needed upgrade to the overall user expereince, which will inspire confidence in users and make crypto more accessible.
