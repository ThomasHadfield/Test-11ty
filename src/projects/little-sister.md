title: Little Sister
subject: Menu Design

description: Little Sister is a Dutch-Indonesian fusion restaurant. They wanted the menu's functionality to be versatile, as menu items are always rotating. The covers of the menus were made from upcycled pieces of custom wallpaper that were used in the restaurant. The menu was designed with a tiered page width in order to easily differentiate between food and drink sections. Little Sister is well known for their custom-crafted cocktails, so the menu was made to be easily separateable, which allows the drink menu to be left behind.
